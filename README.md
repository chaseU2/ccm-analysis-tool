## Dependencies and Acknowledgements

Parts of this project are based on the Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) implementation from the following repository from Prince Javier :

- [Convergent Cross Mapping GitHub Repository Prince Javier ](https://github.com/PrinceJavier/causal_ccm.git)

I have utilized parts of the CCM algorithm from this repository to help analyze causality in time series data in my own project.
